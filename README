hi. this is invaders, a multi boot compliant game for i386.
boot it with grub (http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/)
like this:

root (YOUR ROOT DEVICE)
kernel (YOUR PATH)/invaders
boot

run the compile.sh script to compile the game, or just use the
precompiled image. (do not try to boot "invaders.exec", that's the
wrong file. use "invaders" instead)

the license of the whole project is the GNU General Public License,
see the LICENSE file for details.

have fun,
Erik
